# Electric Cars Analysis in Washington State

This project analyzes the dataset of electric cars registered in Washington state, USA, in 2020. Modified from a DataCamp lab, it showcases data analysis skills, including exploration, visualization, and trend identification.

## Project Overview

The analysis includes:
1. The top 5 most popular make/model combinations of electric cars.
2. The city with the highest number of electric cars registered.
3. The county with the highest number of electric cars registered.
4. The most common model year of the electric cars.
5. The most popular make and model of electric car in Washington state.
6. Comparison of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV).
7. Trends and patterns suggesting future growth or decline in electric car registrations.
